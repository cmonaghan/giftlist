  "readme": "ios-deploy\n==========\nInstall and debug iPhone apps without using Xcode. Designed to work on unjailbroken devices.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Mac OS X. Tested on Snow Leopard only.\n* You need to have a valid iPhone development certificate installed.\n* Xcode must be installed, along with the SDK for your iOS version.\n\n## Usage\n\n./ios-deploy [OPTION]...\n  -d, --debug                  launch the app in GDB after installation\n  -i, --id <device_id>         the id of the device to connect to\n  -c, --detect                 only detect if the device is connected\n  -b, --bundle <bundle.app>    the path to the app bundle to be installed\n  -a, --args <args>            command line arguments to pass to the app when launching it\n  -t, --timeout <timeout>      number of seconds to wait for a device to be connected\n  -u, --unbuffered             don't buffer stdout\n  -g, --gdbargs <args>         extra arguments to pass to GDB when starting the debugger\n  -x, --gdbexec <file>         GDB commands script file\n  -n, --nostart                do not start the app when debugging\n  -v, --verbose                enable verbose output\n  -m, --noinstall              directly start debugging without app install (-d not required) \n  -V, --version                print the executable version\n\n## Demo\n\n* The included demo.app represents the minimum required to get code running on iOS.\n* `make install` will install demo.app to the device.\n* `make debug` will install demo.app and launch a GDB session.\n\n## Notes\n\n* With some modifications, it may be possible to use this without Xcode installed; however, you would need a copy of the relevant DeveloperDiskImage.dmg (included with Xcode). GDB would also run slower as symbols would be downloaded from the device on-the-fly.\n\n\n## Listing Device Ids\n\nDevice Ids are the UDIDs of the iOS devices. From the command line, you can list device ids [this way](http://javierhz.blogspot.com/2012/06/how-to-get-udid-of-iphone-using-shell.html):\n\n        system_profiler SPUSBDataType | sed -n -e '/iPad/,/Serial/p' -e '/iPhone/,/Serial/p' | grep \"Serial Number:\" | awk -F \": \" '{print $2}'\n",
